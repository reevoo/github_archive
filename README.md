# Github Archive

This is a script to archive stuff from our github account to our local git server (git@code).

This is intended to be a one off operation to run prior to deleting the repo of a dead project.

If you need to get the stuff to archive from another organisation, or save it somewhere else than git@code: try editing bin/archive.sh.

## Usage

```
$bin/archive.sh old_project
```
